# VBS-Compiler

VBScript is an Active Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines, and other advanced programming constructs. 

This repo compiles up VBS correctly. It can be used to quick-compile some scripts without creating it manually.
